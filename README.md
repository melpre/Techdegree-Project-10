 My Final Techdegree Project: Full Stack App with React and a REST API

 Project Overview:
 I use React to create a client for an existing school database REST API (that was created in a previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

This project uses React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool to set up the initial project:

I implement JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the application in a modular fashion.
Use of React Router to set up routes.
Use the Fetch API to fetch data from the REST API.
Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
Add to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
